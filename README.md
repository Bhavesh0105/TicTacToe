# TicTacToe
A Java-based Tic-Tac-Toe game with a graphical user interface (GUI). Players take turns selecting empty cells on a 3x3 grid. The game checks for win conditions (rows, columns, diagonals) and declares a winner. It also detects tie conditions and allows for replay. Error handling ensures a smooth user experience.
